# Breast cancer prediction

A hospital wants to predict whether a breast tumor is highly malignant or probably benign or a biopsy needed based on mammogram images, in order to improve early detection and treatment of breast cancer.

The hospital has collected a dataset of mammogram images from patients, including three classes. The images are high-resolution grayscale images from the DDSM dataset.

The mammogram images will be preprocessed using Data Pipeline.

Several deep learning models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, ResNet101, MobileNet, DenseNet201, EfficientNetB7, Xception and InceptionResNetV2 will be tested and evaluated for their performance in classifying the mammogram images as highly alignant or probably benign or biopsy needed. The best-performing model will be selected. They will be evaluated using accuracy as a performance metric.

**Tools :**
Programming language: Python.
Data processing  libraries: pandas, NumPy and scikit-learn.
deep learning libraries: TensorFlow, and Keras.
Deep learning models: VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, ResNet101, MobileNet, DenseNet201, EfficientNetB7, Xception and InceptionResNetV2.
